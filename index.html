			<span>The chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus), a subspecies of the red junglefowl, is a type of domesticated fowl. Chickens are one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with a total population of 23.7 billion as of 2018,[1] up from more than 19 billion in 2011.There are more chickens in the world than any other bird.[2] Humans keep chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming both their meat and eggs) and, less commonly, as pets.</span>

			<h3 class="dish"  id="dish2">Beef</h3>
			<span>A beefsteak, often called just steak, is a flat cut of beef with parallel faces, usually cut perpendicular to the muscle fibers. In common restaurant service a single serving will have a raw mass ranging from 120 to 600 grams (4 to 21 oz). Beef steaks are usually grilled, pan fried, or broiled. The more tender cuts from the loin and rib are cooked quickly, using dry heat, and served whole. Less tender cuts from the chuck or round are cooked with moist heat or are mechanically tenderized (cf. cube steak).</span>

			<h3 class="dish" id="dish3">Sushi</h3>
			<span>Many species of fish are consumed as food in virtually all regions around the world. Fish has been an important source of protein and other nutrients for humans throughout history. English does not have a special culinary name for food prepared from these animals, as it does with pig vs. pork, and as does Spanish pescado vs. pez. In culinary and fishery contexts, fish may include shellfish, such as molluscs, crustaceans and echinoderms; more expansively, seafood covers both fish and other marine life used as food.</span>
